# fundForFloodVictim---Blockchain-DApp

This decentralized application (DApp) is designed to facilitate donations for flood victims using the Ethereum blockchain. Built with Solidity smart contracts and integrated with a web frontend, the app allows donors to register, make donations, and track total funds using MetaMask for transaction approval. The system runs on a local Ethereum network using Ganache for development and testing. Truffle framework is used to facilitate the web interface creation.



## Features

- **Donor Registration**: Allows users to register as a donor by providing their name and mobile number.
- **Donation**: Donors can donate Ether to the chosen zone (Sylhet, Chittagong South, or Chittagong North) using their registered mobile number.
- **Donation Tracking**: The DApp allows users to view the donation balances for each zone.
- **Donor Information**: Donors can verify their registration details by entering their Ethereum account address.



## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Node.js** installed on your local machine (version 12.x or higher).
- **Truffle** Framework installed globally (`npm install -g truffle`).
- **Ganache** to create a local Ethereum blockchain for testing.
- **MetaMask** installed in your browser to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.
- **Solidity** Compiler to compile the smart contracts.



## Smart Contract Overview
The main smart contract file is located in `contracts/fundForFloodVictims.sol`. Here's a brief overview of the functionality:

- **Fundraiser Accounts**: Predefined Ethereum addresses representing the zones (Sylhet, Chittagong South, and Chittagong North) where donations will be sent.
- **Donor Registration**: Users can register as a donor by providing a name and mobile number. Each address can only register once.
- **Donations**: After registering, donors can donate Ether to any of the three zones. Donations are only accepted from registered donors.
- **Donation Info**: Users can check the total amount of donations each zone has received.
- **Donor Info**: Users can check their own registration details by providing their Ethereum address.

## Frontend Overview
The frontend is written in HTML, JavaScript, and Bootstrap and uses Web3.js to interact with the smart contract.

**Features:**

- **Donor Registration**: Users can register as a donor via a simple form.
